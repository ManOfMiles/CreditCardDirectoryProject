# CreditCardDirectoryProject
This is a project and is not complete. Will integrate with sqlite to allow management of credit card directory.

The premise of this project is to create a database directory of numerous credit cards. My website www.milestothemax.com posts many of the current travel credit card offers. This will allow me to store, update, and retrieve credit card offers with ease. 

The required fields will be: card name, bank, currency, bonus, annual_fee, earn_rate, min_spend.
